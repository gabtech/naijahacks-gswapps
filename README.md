<b>INSPIRATION:</b><br /><br />

I was homeless for about 3 years in Lagos, i was basically sleeping in a church while working there as an assistant to a pastor.<br />

This has led me to come up with the idea of building an app where very low income earners could search for cheap accommodations for rent, as well properties and office space for rent or for sale. So that people like me wouldn't be a burden, liability, or a case for suspicion in our society. <br />
